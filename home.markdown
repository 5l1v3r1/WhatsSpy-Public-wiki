# What is WhatsSpy Public?

WhatsSpy is an web-oriented application that tracks every move of whoever you like to follow. This application is setup as an Proof of Concept that Whatsapp is broken in terms of privacy. Once you've setup this application you can track users that you want to follow on Whatsapp. Once it's running it keeps track of the following activities:

* Online/Offline status (even with privacy options to nobody)
* Profile pictures
* Privacy settings
* Status messages

*For reference view [this blog article about the Whatsapp Privacy problem](https://maikel.pro/blog/).*
