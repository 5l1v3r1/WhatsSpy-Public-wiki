# Tracker shutdown errors

WhatsSpy Public might stop tracking due to some unforseen reason. This will show up in the timeline page, this is why you need to keep a look on this page.

## Connection Closed!

There can be various reasons for a "connection closed" error. One of the most common problems is a unreliable internet connection, bad hardware or a busy network. If it keeps disconnecting with this message in a short timespan you need to stop the tracker, wait a few days and try to re-connect. This seems to be a problem at WhatsApp.

## Login failed!

Either the phonenumber is wrong, secret is wrong or your account has been disabled by WhatsApp. Make sure you do not need use a free SMS service. You need a legitimate phonenumber. Also make sure you [entered your phonenumber correct](https://gitlab.maikel.pro/maikeldus/WhatsSpy-Public/wikis/getting-started#2-4-setup-the-config).

## Tree length did not match received length!

Restart the tracker. If this does not work wait a few hours and try again. This is an unknown problem caused at WhatsApp side.
