# Tracker shutdown errors

WhatsSpy Public might stop tracking due to some unforseen reason. This will show up in the timeline page, this is why you need to keep a look on this page.

## Connection Closed!

There can be various reasons for a "connection closed" error. One of the most common problems is a unreliable internet connection, bad hardware or a busy network. If it keeps disconnecting with this message in a short timespan you need to stop the tracker, wait a few days and try to re-connect. This seems to be a problem at WhatsApp.
